# Retail_Sales_Analysis

This repo contains all the files used in Retail Sales Project. This project is completed end to end using AWS, Snowflake, Jupyter Notebook and POwer BI.

This dataset contains household-level transactions over two years from a group
of 2,500 households who are frequent shoppers at a retailer. It contains all of
each household’s purchases, not just those from a limited number of categories.
For households, demographic information as well as direct marketing contact
history are included.

The Retail’s database keeps track of the following data fields:
hh_demographic, campaign_desc, campaign_table, coupon, coupon_redempt, product and  transaction_data.
